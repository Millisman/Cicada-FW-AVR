 * \class Scheduler
 *
 * Simple cooperative scheduler to run instances of Task. To use Scheduler and Task,
 * do the following:
 *
 * 1. Inherit from Task and implement run(), which contains the actual code
 * you want to execute in regular intervals.
 * 2. Create a NULL-terminated array with pointers to your tasks:
 * ```
 * Task* taskList[] = { &task1, &task2, NULL };
 * ```
 * 3. Create a Scheduler, which takes the system tick function (usually the global
 * eTickFunction()) and the task list as parameters in the constructor:
 * ```
 * Scheduler s(&eTickFunction, taskList);
 * ```
 * 4. Call `s.start()` to run the main loop. This function runs in an indefinite
 * loop and never returns. Alternatively, you can also call `s.runTask()`
 * in your own loop.
